**PREDICTING THE RESULTS OF A FOOTBALL GAME**

**RESEARCH QUESTION**

I have been tasked to act as the football analyst for the Mchezopesa Limted Company to predict the result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (including the rank in my training).

**METRICS FOR SUCCESS**

To create two models that are reliable and accurate to predict:

Model 1: how many goals the home team scores.
Model 2: how many goals the away team scores.

**UNDERSTANDING THE CONTEXT**

Football or soccer has become a sensational game accross the globe with supporters and fans in each and every region of the world. A rise has been noticed in the use of data by organizations and individuals to enhance the game and gain competitive advantage. FIFA, football governing body, has ranked countries based on the past results in various global tournaments. We will use the datasets from FIFA to create the models.

**EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN**

Perform your EDA

Perform any necessary feature engineering

Check of multicollinearity

Start building the model

Approach 1: Polynomial approach

Model 1: Predict how many goals the home team scores.
Model 2: Predict how many goals the away team scores.
Approach 2: Logistic approach

Feature Engineering: Figure out from the home team’s perspective if the game is a Win, Lose or Draw (W, L, D)
Cross-validate the model

Compute RMSE

Create residual plots for your models, and assess their heteroscedasticity using Bartlett’s test.

Perform appropriate regressions on the data including your justification

Challenge your solution by providing insights on how you can make improvements.

**DATA RELEVANCE**

These datasets have been extracted from the FIFA official website.

The two datasets are:

Rank Dataset - contains team rankings from 1993 to 2018.
Results Dataset - contains games and the team scores from 1892 to 2019.
